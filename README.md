This repository contains the MATLAB code used to run the experiments for our thesis, *"Heavy is the Head: The Effect of Responsibility on Delegation"*, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SbCxeAW9Kc_opEfYIu0tprc5hGTjmVbD/view?usp=sharing).

Each subject in the experiment is given a delegation task, the results of which we use to measure their propensity to under-delegate and their risk premium. Subjects can be exposed to one of three treatments: no responsibility, anonymous responsibility and visible responsibility.

To start an experiment, run `main_task_script.m` and enter the relevant details in the command line. The number assigned to each subject determines which treatment they are given -- see the code for more details.

The folder `data/` contains examples of how data from the experiment is stored and saved. (These examples do not correspond to actual subjects.)
